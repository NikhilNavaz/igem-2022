        <br>
        <p>
          Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, or nearly one in every six. Each year, approximately 400,000 children develop cancer. In recent years even with the advancements in genomic, proteomic, and bioinformatics methods revealing the complex interaction of variables responsible for malignant phenotypes. We have had occasional successes and the treatment for most of the cancers are still a long way from reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional cancer treatment is predicated on the notion that all somatic cells are equally malignant. Both malignant and normal cells are equally susceptible to existing chemotherapy medicines, thus, it kills both rapidly growing cancer cells and normal cells. This leads to many adverse effects or even death in some cases. Untargeted radiotherapy also faces similar specificity issues. Even for targeted drugs there are several flaws for example : antibody-drug conjugates often cause great side effects; pathway inhibitor drugs rely on specific pathways which sometimes can be bypassed by tumour cells.</p>
        <p>
          As we were informed of all these issues, we were determined to find a means to aid the millions of people suffering from cancer and its harsh treatment side effects. We began by learning how cancer medicines function and tried to get to the bottom of the issue. It was immediately apparent that present drug delivery systems were severely inadequate due to their unaffordable costs and off-site targeting. Therefore, we chose to build a more robust affordable drug delivery system with improved specificity and efficacy.</p>
        <p>
          Thus we formed a group of 15 enthusiastic research students to seek and tackle the challenge of offsite targeting by leveraging the ability of synthetic biology and combining the many features of cancer medication therapy in a synergistic manner. We started working extensively towards this goal and eventually it led to the creation of <strong>DUONCO</strong>, a novel dual nanovesicle drug delivery system that we think has the potential to reduce off-site targeting and to our knowledge is the first time such a dual marker system has been designed for targeted therapy.</p>
        <p>
          Our next objective was to select a suitable model for our project. We went through literature on current statistics of cancer rates in India and found out that breast cancer has become the most prevalent form of cancer with the highest rate of incidence and highest mortality rate. A few  of our members also attended a medical camp held in our community, where they learned about the dramatic increase in breast cancer cases and their lack of knowledge on the disease's diagnosis, causes, and treatments. This motivated us to select breast cancer as our model disease and move toward the development of our drug delivery system.</p>
        <p>
          As our project progressed, we engaged with oncologists, doctors, and drug delivery specialists to pick an appropriate nanovesicle, accessible biomarkers, and to finalise a few other components of our prototype. Our project modelling proved to be incredibly useful for comprehending OMV internalisation, augmenting our wetlab. With the aid of stakeholder interactions and their suggestions, we were able to choose and modify our components. While speaking with non-governmental organisations (Hair for Hope, Knitted Knockers), we observed the lack of knowledge and facilities and stigmas around breast cancer. This motivated us to organise awareness talks and drama, screening camp, hair donation campaign, awareness pamphlets, and various other outreach events to spread the word. We also conducted a survey via online and offline platforms to analyse their awareness on breast cancer and related topics. This gave us insights on people's misconceptions such as: males cannot get breast cancer, breast cancer can cause pregnancy issues.  So we made it a point to ensure that all of these issues were covered while preparing our outreach initiatives. Our meeting with companies and the government startup commission helped to get perspective on how to further our concept, and enabled us to build a suitable plan to introduce DUONCO to the public in the best manner.

        <br>
        <p>
          When we started exploring more about our project we felt it would be best to develop a framework to execute our IHP effectively. Each step was planned in a manner that would help in working out the one that followed it. Our team used this method to ensure that discussions and lessons learned from one project stage were carried over and incorporated into the next. This made it easier for us to ensure that <strong>DUONCO</strong> as a drug delivery system mirrored the values determined to be significant to our stakeholders.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The opinions of stakeholders, drug delivery experts, academics, cancer scientists, pharmaceutical companies, the general public, caretakers and doctors have all contributed significantly to determining the course of our project at each level of our human-centred, four-step approach to IHP.

        <h2 id="subhead2.1">Understanding the problem</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          As we began with our project we realised it was of utmost importance that we try to understand how large of a problem we are addressing? Who are the people this work would impact? What is currently being done to tackle the issue? What resources we can obtain for this?</p>
        <p>
          As a first stage for addressing these questions we took several measures being: Preparing survey to analyse the publics awareness on the subject, scouring through literature to gain a wider understanding of the severity of the issue and its significance in our society and talking to social scientists. These helped us identify our major stakeholders them being:
        <ul>
          <li>Patients, Pharmaceutical companies and oncologists</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>
          As a second stage of understanding our problem we interacted with our major stakeholders.</p>
        <p>
          We held interviews with survivors (Interviewed 7 survivors) and doctors(4 doctors) about the cost, efficacy, efficiency and affordability of current targeted drugs, talked to pharma companies (<a href="https://www.sanofi.in/">Sanofi Amentis</a>) to understand from the start of funding research for medicines to each stage of trials, marketing strategies and legal procedures.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="subhead2.2">Ideate</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Having identified and understood the multiple adverse aspects of the current cancer therapy problem, our team began brainstorming solutions.</p>
        <p>
          After discussing and analyzing our stakeholders' needs, we decided on a synthetic biology solution. These are all aimed at an effective mechanism to administer the medicine to the affected cells and keep other cells safe. It was also where current methods fell short due to their high cost, lack of specificity, and failure in providing a sustained immunogenic action.</p>
        <p>
          Key Points We Received From Our Stakeholders Are:
          <ol>
            <li>Financially affordable and economical access to cancer therapy</li>
            <li>A solution for offsite targeting</li>
            <li>Safe to environment</li>
            <li>Inform the public about synthetic biology and its application in therapeutics to debunk any stigmas associated with GMOs.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          This was our inspiration to research literature and finally select Outer membrane vesicles of E Coli (OMV) as our nanocarrier for its adjuvanṁt properties along with supporting information of its efficiency as a drug carrier in invivo experiments (Cite gujarati paper). We met with several experts : (Denice Bay, Gujarati, MRN) to decide upon OMVs and the usage of dual OMV systems to enhance the specificity of the therapeutic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          We finally chose our model to be breast cancer, realising its significance in our immediate locality from statistics and our firsthand interactions during UBA (UNNAT BHARAT ABHIYAN) medical camps. The surge in breast cancer cases was truly shaking. People’s stigma and lack of access to diagnostics and credible resources were also few reasons for us choosing it as our model.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Define a Solution</h2>
        <p>
          To form a solution we continually met with our stakeholders and integrated their feedback throughout the design process and thus we made our efforts to ensure <strong>DUONCO</strong> holistically embodies the needs of everyone involved in our stakeholder chart.</p>
        <p><strong>add line to divide text situation</strong></p>
        <p>
          Our final identified value was that the solution be financially viable and scalable, allowing realistic implementation of the solution. Synthetic biology lends itself well to being scalable, and has great potential to be a financially viable solution. Thus we made it a point to keep our four points from stakeholders during ideating to be the driving factor of our design for DUONCO.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Evaluate and Execute</h2>
        <p>
          To make sure we practice proper safety measures all the team members attended a biosafety seminar given by our biosafety officer Dr Poonam Thakur, we visited IMAGE (Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly), the biomedical waste treatment and disposal project to learn about what is done with waste we generate. Proposed implementation, ensuring closing the loop, ?
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with an awareness analysing survey, we proceeded on to conducting public interviews to understand people's needs and their understanding of breast cancer. We realised that people from lower economic backgrounds particularly couldn't afford diagnosis or treatment for the disease. So we conducted a <strong>breast cancer screening camp</strong> at our campus along with an awareness talk by our medical officer Dr. Hemalatha Goldwin. We then proceeded onto collaborating with NGOs : the <strong>Knitted Knockers</strong> and <strong> Hair for Hope </strong>to gain understanding on how to reach a wider audience and network. We later organised hair donation camps and women talk series to raise awareness and help people suffering from breast cancer. We collaborated with fellow iGEM teams and made lab tour videos, and released an awareness survey. We distributed information pamphlets in various public spaces and also performed an awareness spreading drama at a stage garnering several audiences at the heart of the Thiruvananthapuram city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our entire project, including the IHP journey, has been focused on people, and the proposed implementation is no different. Returning to our stakeholders and specialists throughout the implementation planning phase allowed us to close the loop and make decisions based on their values and needs in terms of ethics, technology, safety, and communication. Talking to the <strong>Government Startup Commission</strong> and drug delivery companies we were able to devise a proper future plan to scale DUONCO to its next level.

        <h2>Section 1</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The number of cancer cases rose to 19.3 million cases in 2020 and death statistics reached 10 million in the same year. It is predicted to increase to 30 million cases and 16.3 million deaths by 2040. Due to its increasing figures, cancer research is an ever-evolving field. Extensive efforts by countless researchers in the past have opened up diverse options for therapeutic intervention. However, a fundamental issue in drug therapy for cancer is that current chemotherapeutic drugs have poor specificity and indiscriminately affect cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Chemotherapy, one of the most widely used therapeutic causes numerous side effects like hair fall, nausea, vomiting, infection, and anaemia. Overall, it weakens the patient. The patient's physical and mental health will be impacted. The treatment technique of Radiotherapy also causes similar exhaustion and weakness. We decided to work on a treatment technique that reduces the side effects.

        <p>
          We had an interaction with Dr. Kavitha Ravi who is an additional professor for Pathology at Government medical college, Thiruvananthapuram. She gave insights on the number of cancer cases in our nearest city Thiruvananthapuram. She highlighted the possibility of targeted therapy where only cancerous cells will be affected and how this is being increasingly researched in the scientific community.  She visited our institute and gave awareness talk to the workers of our institute.</p>

        <br>
        <p>
          To better understand the side effects of current treatment methods, we spoke with a teacher who had cancer and has since recovered. She was 44 years old when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was tested after discovering a lump in her breast. She recalls her treatment as a traumatic experience. She encountered difficulties during her chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She lost her hair and her body became weak. She also had lymphedema on her left hand as a result of having her left breast removed. She could not go to work for a long period of time. Talking to her helped us understand the desperate need for a treatment that can reduce the side effects. She was also willing to use the treatment method that uses genetically modified organisms, as long as these severe side effects are reduced. This ensured that people will be most willing to use therapeutics prepared using genetically modified organisms and hence we could proceed with a method using synthetic biology. This interaction also made us aware that lymphedema is a common condition for people who have undergone mastectomy. We decided to interact with respective stakeholders to get better understanding about mastectomy. In addition, we decided to meet more cancer survivors and have a better understanding of the frequent issues patients confront throughout treatment in order to address some of them through our project

        <p>
          To know about current treatment methods other than chemotherapy, we visited KIMS Health Centre in Thiruvananthapuram. We met Dr. Bharath V.M., the surgical oncologist at KIMS. He introduced us to Breast-conserving surgery (BCS), where only the lump with roots will be removed surgically. It is also known as lumpectomy. He pointed out that all patients cannot undergo BCS. Even the patients who have undergone BCS may need to go through other treatment methods later like radiation therapy, hormone therapy or chemotherapy. BCS can have side effects like pain, scar, dimples, or lymphedema in the arm. We understood that a better treatment method is essential. Then, he described the seriousness of HER2-positive breast cancer. It is a particularly aggressive kind of breast cancer. There are various forms of cancer. Mutation in each type is very different. A scoring approach is used to establish the stage of HER2+ breast cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immunohistochemistry scores range from 0 to 3 to indicate the degree of HER2+ protein expression on the surface of breast cancer cells. A score of 0 to 1+ indicates it is HER2-. A score of 2+ shows the cells are on borderline and a score of 3+ indicates it is HER2+.

          <strong>Drug Delivery</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          Our interactions with a number of physicians and cancer survivors helped us understand the problems that patients endure throughout treatment due to the medicine's adverse effects. These sessions provided a good reminder that a more effective treatment strategy is necessary that utilises the currently existing therapy medication, which has been shown to be extremely beneficial, but delivers it to cancer cells via a more effective delivery method. We chose to design a novel drug delivery method that specifically targets cancer cells by connecting to receptors on the surface of cancer cells.

        <h3>Unnat Bharat Abhiyan</h3>
        <h5>Central Government Initiative</h5>
        <br>
        <p>
          In 2020, breast cancer became the cancer with the highest gross incidence and mortality, both in India and worldwide. There were 2.3 million people diagnosed with breast cancer and 685,000 deaths globally. Breast cancer also places a significant financial, physical and mental burden on patients and their families. Hence even though improving the specificity of chemotherapy is a longstanding problem relevant to all types of cancers, we wanted to center our project on breast cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
          UBA or Unnat Bharat Abhiyan is a central government initiative that enables higher education institutions to visit rural areas of India and bring in development in those areas. On International Women's Day 2021, some of our team members volunteered for a breast cancer screening camp in association with the UBA committee of our institute at a nearby village of Chathancode, Kerala. Even in our little community of Vithura (with a population of 20,000), the incidence of breast cancer patients was alarmingly high. This demonstrated the severity of this disease and the urgent need for a more effective treatment method. These statistics led us to choose breast cancer as a model to perform our study.

        <h3>Survivor Interviews</h3>
        <h5>Hello</h5>
        <br>
        <p>
            The end users of our novel drug delivery method are the patients. Getting to know of their difficulties and expectations is essential. Cancer is a widely spoken topic. However, there are fewer discussed aspects of breast cancer. Less frequently discussed are the obstacles that patients face during therapy, including mental and physical frailty, societal pressure, and financial concerns. Therefore, we interviewed five individuals who had been cured of breast cancer. We obtained their permission prior to conducting our semi-structured interview. Their perspectives on various breast cancer elements are described <a class="button" id="six">here</a>.

              <p style="text-align: left;">
                <strong>Awareness level: </strong>People lack knowledge on early detection. Typically, cancer signs are not recognised until a later stage, making treatment challenging. Most of the interviewees shared similar experiences.When a lump developed, no treatment was administered. Only when it began to spread did they conduct tests. Even minor ignorance can cost a great deal.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Side Effects: </strong>Most of the participants have undergone chemotherapy and some have undergone radiation therapy and/or immunotherapy along with chemotherapy. Many of them have undergone surgery (mastectomy) before getting any other treatment as they detected the disease at later stages. Receiving multiple treatments has severely affected the patients. Almost all of them were physically weak and felt nauseous during the treatment period. Lymphedema was experienced by patients who have undergone mastectomy and had to undergo physiotherapy. Hair loss was experienced by the patients after undergoing chemotherapy. Several other side effects were shared by the patients like difficulty swallowing, low blood count, constipation, and vomiting.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Social life and mental health: </strong>All the participants' lives were altered by contracting this condition. Their career, family, and social lives were all affected. During the treatment period, they were unable to work due to the chemotherapy sessions and the fatigue that followed each session. Patients who were homemakers were also affected.
                <br>
                The interviewees described their feelings of mental fragility throughout those eras, when society regarded them differently. People treated them with compassion, which made them uneasy. Many of them struggled financially during those times.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Future Directions: </strong>Participants discussed treatment strategies and societal attitudes concerning cancer patients. They are willing to take drugs containing GMOs till their safety is verified. They want the procedure to have fewer negative side effects. It should have no other effect on their health. Additionally, they desired that the new treatment avoid hair loss. In addition, they desired that people with cancer be treated equally and without prejudice.

        To solve the current treatment problems, we introduced DUONCO, a novel dual drug delivery system. With this project, we hope to develop a prototype for a versatile system that furthers the specificity of drug therapy in cancer. DUONCO uses OMVs (Outer Membrane Vesicle) engineered to express epitopes targeting two HER2+ breast cancer cell-surface markers. Hence there will be two types of OMVs expressing two types of proteins. Type A OMV will be loaded with prodrig and Type B will be loaded with enzyme. The dual marker targeting approach is an improvement over current single marker targeted therapies. Although DUONCO is developed for breast cancer, it can be improved to target other type of cancers as well. We had several doubts regarding choosing the target molecules and we interacted with experts in this field to understand better on the topic.

        Ms Monica P. is a PhD student working under the supervision of Dr Natesh Ramanathan, Assistant Professor of IISER Thiruvananthapuram. Our project DUONCO focussed on targeting two receptors that are overexpressed in cancer cells. Type A targets HER2 which is a commonly targeted receptor and Type B OMV focuses on targeting C5AR1, which is a novel target. She suggested that given the time constraint, it would be better if the team concentrated more on TYPE 2 OMV first since that is the novel aspect of the project. She also gave us a lot of practical suggestions. According to her suggestion, we planned our wet lab works such that type 2 OMV synthesis is focused.

        Dr. Denice Bay is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases at the University of Manitoba. She worked with OMVs to understand its formation associated with cationic antimicrobials and its application to reduce antimicrobial resistance (AMR) infections. Interaction with Dr. Denice helped us to optimise our OMV isolation protocol as her earlier work included isolating OMVs from bacteria. She advised us on following centrifugation rather than ultra filtration as filters are expensive. As a result of her experience isolating OMV, she is certain that culture with antibiotics will not result in significant side effects. She recommended freezing the culture at -20°C. She even recommended the use of OmpA Antibody for OMV detection. Throughout our OMV isolation, her counsel was crucial. We were able to complete the task effectively.

          We had several queries regarding drug delivery. We approached Dr. Kurapati to clarify these aspects. Dr. Rajendra Kurapati is the Assistant Professor in School of Chemistry at IISER Thiruvananthapuram. He is working on developing functional biodegradable materials for biomedical applications as the nanoparticles currently used in various fields are non-biodegradable. He has experience working on nanoparticles and in drug delivery. He recommended performing dls or TEM after OMV isolation for confirmation. He opened up the possibilities of other receptors like Folate receptor alpha present on epithelial cells and overexpressed on cancer cells. This helped us to understand the other future potential receptors that can be targeted using OMVs especially as folate receptors are overexpressed in triple negative breast cancerous cells.

He is currently the Distinguished Professor and AstraZeneca Chair at the Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology. Prof.Murty raised valid questions regarding the formation of OMV, its solubility, its contents, immune systems action mechanism against it and also the structural similarities of its HER2 target. Since we met him around the inception of our project, his suggestions were important in shaping it. It helped us to go further into our plan. He suggested on performing Cryo TEM for better visualisation of OMVs because heat from TEM can lead to membrane structure deformation.

          We met Prof. Chakravortty for performing Cryo TEM as the facility was not available in our institute. She guided us to Dr. Somnath in IISc. Prof. Chakravortty is a renowned  microbiologist and a pathologist who works as a professor at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. She was awarded National Bioscience Award for Career Development, one of the highest Science Award by Government of India. She suggested not using electroporation method for insertion of prodrug and enzyme as it will be difficult for the large molecules to get internalised. This does assist us in investigating other approaches for effective and rapid internalisation. We did a lot more reading to acquire better knowledge. She also brought up the topic of internalising enzymes in type2 OMV. She proposed substituting mRNA for enzymes and creating a prodrug-mRNA system. We also decided to read more on this and choose an efficient system. She suggested an alternative method to verify internalisation of the OMVs that did not involve the prodrug and enzyme. She proposed using small dye molecules as cargo to monitor internalisation. We were unable to conduct these experiments, but they provide a viable method for tracking the movement of OMVs after internalisation.
          <br>
          She guided us in various aspects of our project and became our external mentor.

Apart from her years of experience as histopathologist, she along with few other doctors developed an called Brexa. It helps people to detect Breast Cancer early and guide us for further treatment. Its being used by thousands of people round the world. It guides people to perform self breast examination. We got an opportunity to interact with her. She reviewed our survey questions and made sure the questions are relevant. She highlighted on the fact that there are other types of breast cancer than HER2 positive ones. Although number of cases for other types are comparatively less, they are high grade. It can be lethal. The receptors that our project target are absent in other types of breast cancer. We decided to read more on other types of breast cancers and the potential receptors that can be targeted. This will help in expanding DUONCO to a wide variety of cancers. She shared the problem of poor detection of breast cancer in India where people are not voluntarily performing screeing tests. We understood the need for awareness in our society. We planned numerous awareness programs to do our part in early detection.

Dr Vipul Gujrati is Research Scientist and Consultant at the Institute for Biological and Medical Imaging, TUM Germany. He has great experience in various fields like drug discovery, non-clinical pharmacology, bioimaging, scientific writing, immune and regenerative therapy. After the discussion with Dr. Gujrati he offered to provide us with the plasmid containing the genes for (Cly A-Linker-Tag-Affibody) construct.Through this interaction we were able to learn that mutations of the msbB gene and tol-pal gene are not necessarily required as they won't considerably reduce the toxicity or increase yield respectively. Length of the linker and the order of linker and tag can be flexible and can be suited according to the requirements. Our doubts on electroporation was clarified using his paper. Through his meeting we were able to narrow down our wet-lab procedures more accurately as we got valuable insights from him.

          <p>
            She is one of the authors of "Selection of a new peptide homing SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells". In this paper, they discovered a peptide, Pep-1, which selectively binds to the HER2+ breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3. Our meeting provided us with insights about the functioning of the peptide and its potential for us in a targeted delivery system like Duonco.
          </p>
          <p>
            For successful delivery of the THP-OMV to the cancer cell, binding of the THP is not sufficient. Subsequent internalisation is also necessary. No experiments were done at physiological temperatures with Pep-1, hence its behaviour with respect to internalisation were unknown. She suggested that since other THPs generally internalise following binding, it is likely that Pep-1 will as well. We discussed the difficulties associated with culturing the cell lines mentioned in the paper (MCF-10-2A and MCF-10A) and explored alternative cell lines that could be use to test Pep-1. From our discussion, HEK 293 emerged as an appealing alternative, given that it does not usually overexpress the target markers of Pep-1. Pep-1 contains cysteine at the C and N terminus. Dr. Ferreria helped us understand the role of these residues in the binding ability of the the peptide by conferring a loop structure to it. She also mentioned that she has been utilizing homing peptides for vesicle-based delivery, and that the requirement of a disulphide bond should not be an issue during protein expression in a bacterial system.

He asked us to determine the drug concentration necessary to kill cancerous cells. This will assist us in determining how much prodrug or enzyme can be loaded onto OMVs. This allows further calculation of pore size. Kinetics plays an important role here. We planned to use a hydrophilic dye for research into internalisation. He suggested employing lipohilic dye. We realised that the use of lipohilic dye was a vastly superior alternative to the use of hydrophilic dye and decided to employ the former in our future laboratory work. His advice proved to be extremely beneficial.

            <br>
            To study how OMV will be internalised into cancer cells, we decided to study on mammalian cell lines. But we were unsure on which cells to use and how to proceed. We interacted with experts working on these fields.
            <br>
            We met with Dr. Ramray Bhat, Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. He guided us on proper usage, viability and availability of different cell lines. According to his opinion HMLE cell lines are better than MCF10 A. It made us aware to look into other available cell lines and  select cell lines for control experiments. To understand more on MCF10A cell lines, we contacted Dr. Medhavi Vishwakarma. She directed us to doctoral candidate Ms. Sindhu M. She highlighted the difficulties while working with MCF10 A. Reaching confluency might be delayed without the presence of cholera toxin in medium for MCF10 A culturing. We then interacted with Dr. Rakesh S. Laishram. He gave inputs on the quantification of OMVs and showed the possibility of using fluorophores for detection.

          <h5>Assitant Professor, RCC Thiruvananthapuram</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            Dr. Rona is the Assistant Professor at the department of oncology at RCC (Regional Cancer Centre). After completing her M.B.B.S., she earned her M.D. and D.M. from prestigious institutions. She discussed the adverse effects of chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic treatments during our meeting. She urged us to continue developing our project. She then informed us of the other available targeted therapy. Already available are therapies that target antibodies. T-DM1 is an FDA-approved, effective drug for treating HER2-positive breast cancer. In addition, GMO-based pharmaceuticals are also available. Although all of these medications are available on the market, none of them are ideal. She discussed one of the side effects of antibody-directed therapy. Resistance development was a major drawback of this method. To determine whether our treatment has similar side effects, it must undergo clinical trials. She emphasised the fact that during clinical trials, the majority of drugs are typically rejected, and that only after multiple stages of testing can the efficacy of a particular treatment be confirmed.

                      <li>The initial step is preclinical lab work, and if a product is approved and appropriate, it goes to Phase one, two, three trials. Following that a  country-specific  local trial is required in some places while others only require Phase 3 regulations. Most countries agree to launch with an assurance of PMS (post-market surveillance). Few countries  also proceed to test real-world efficacy (RWE). </li>
                      <li>The second step includes the evaluation of : markets, population classifications, and paying capability. Modern medical treatment should combine safety, adherence, quality of life, targeted delivery, and other factors for effective therapy. Government approval is also necessary. NICE (The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK) reviews treatment reimbursement based on HTA (health technology assessment) standards. Market prices are set using International Reference Pricing.</li>
                      <li>Step three includes commercialising, conceptualising, engaging, and consumer understanding.

            We had questions about how to proceed with our project in the future, and we learned that cost we fix will vary depending on whether the project is in its early phases and whether it requires a licence or a proof of concept.We didn't see how a drug delivery system would be different. She enumerated the pros and cons. Bioequivalence tests are needed. Using an existing medicine increases safety, but we must first pass an inferiority trial. But this would reduce failures in phase one, two, three trials.She also discussed how a delivery system IP patent can be obtained if the conceptualization can be proven. She advised us to refer to CDSCO, Drugs and cosmetics act under DCGI. The act requires clinical trial phase three in the intended country or a waiver promising phase four. We were also introduced to a commercially available nanoparticle-based targeted delivery method, Abraxane, to refer more and develop our future direction.

            Safety has been an integral part of our project from the very beginning. To ensure we did our part in safety we interacted with few people and also did a thorough literature review to learn the safety rules and law governing the usage of genetically modified organisms. We were thus able to adopt valuable feedback and prepare consents and get the concerned approvals for our work.

            We met with Dr Rahul to gain insights into how to safely engineer cytolysin A as a display system for our OMVs. In the past few years, he has worked intensively with ClyA to determine how natural ClyA can operate as a toxin against mammalian cells. He provided the following recommendations given <a class="button" id="six">here</a>.

                    <ul>
                      <li>He clarified that the protomeric form of ClyA was the predominant conformation in the bacterial outer membrane and that ClyA does not cause significant leakage of cargo from vesicles or of periplasm from bacteria, which strengthened our choice to use ClyA in our project.</li>
                      <li>We also gained some valuable suggestion that certain substitution mutations could be made to attenuate ClyA and it could effectively prevent its toxicity by inhibiting oligomerization.He suggested us the mutation to attenuate ClyA Mutation: The Y178F mutation in the cholesterol binding motif of the beta-tongue of ClyA prevents oligomerization into a pore-forming complex and hinders the pore forming ability on mammalian cell membranes. </li>
                    </ul>
                    This mutation helps us secure the required level of safety for our Cytolysin A study.

            IMAGE is the abbreviation for Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-friendly. The initiative was initiated by the Indian medical association. It has an effective method for treating biowaste. The waste generated by hospitals and laboratories is collected, transported, and separated into various categories. It is divided primarily into four colours: red, yellow, blue, and white. After proper separation, these wastes are treated differently based on their type. Some are passed through hot furnaces and made into ashes. Some are recycled. To better comprehend these, we travelled to the IMAGE Plant in Palakkad, a district in Kerala. The facility was equipped with extensive facilities for treating various types of bio waste. We created a documentary to inform the public about IMAGE.

            We meticulously researched the present legislation and regulations set by the Ministry of Science and Technology's Department of Biotechnology (DBT). The DBT supports and oversees biotechnology development, as well as establishes guidelines for safe practises and laws for managing genetic engineering in India. Their Biosafety Research Programme emphasises the implementation of biosafety procedures, rules, and guidelines under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 and Rules 1989 to ensure user and environmental safety from the use of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and products thereof in research and application. The programme mandated a two-tier process consisting of Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBSC) at the Institute/company and the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) in the Department of Biotechnology. As a result, we were able to obtain the necessary instructions from their online resources and apply for IBSC and RCGM approval.

          <p>
            The Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore hosted AIIM, the regional gathering of all Indian iGEM teams, during July 23–25, 2022. AIIM gave us a forum where we could talk, work together, and improve our presentation abilities while also picking up fresh information from subject-matter specialists.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were really fortunate to have an offline AIIM event this year. The three-day event was jam-packed with presentations by synthetic biology specialists, team projects and poster displays, workshops from the iGEM Indian league and the iGEM EPIC, fireside chats, and a tonne of other entertaining activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the teams were able to get a feel for the final project presentations, thanks to the mock jamboree-style presentations that were held for each team.
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, out of the 14 teams from IISc, IISERs, and IITs, our team performed successfully in various categories.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>First runner up: </strong>Elevator pitch contest organised by iGEM EPIC (entrepreneurship wing of iGEM)</li>
              <li><strong>Honorary mention: </strong>Best poster presentation</li>
              <li><strong>Honorary mention: </strong>Best-wet lab</li>
              <li><strong>Honorary mention: </strong>Best human practices</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The AIIM turned out to be incredibly instructive for us. We also had the opportunity to respond to, incorporate, and develop the judges' queries and ideas into our product. Our team had an absolutely wonderful experience participating in the AIIM.

          <h5>Presentation open to all of IISER Thiruvananthapuram</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            Once we had a clear understanding of our ideas, our team thought it would be fantastic to have a grant reveal for our project. So on World Cancer Day (February 4, 2022), we used a fun interactive mystery question to disclose the project's theme, and students could guess it by filling out a Google Form. To promote our initiative, we also placed posters throughout the campus and had a selfie competition with the poster.
          </p>
          <p>
            After much anticipation, on April 13, 2022, we formally introduced our project concept and team to the faculty, staff, and students of our institute. To a group of more than 100 people, each team member introduced themselves and talked about the project and its different subteams. During the event, we also unveiled OMIVON, our team mascot.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the help of the Mentor-Mentee app, which incorporates user ideas, we got to learn which social media platforms the audience prefers and how they view synthetic biology. Later, we planned and designed our human practices and outreach initiatives using these inputs. The previous iGEM team from our university also gave a speech about how iGEM had aided their development over the previous year. Additionally, we were able to get a lot of feedback from the audience, which was helpful for the project.

          <p>
            The Frontier Symposia in Biology are annual, 2-day conferences organised by the School of Biology, IISER Thiruvananthapuram. This year the symposium was held from 29 April – 01 May 2022 at our campus. The meetings were a platform for discussing cutting-edge research topics in all fields of biology. Students and researchers from across the country came together to meet and discuss science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team had been fortunate enough to attend the conference and meet with Dr. Manidipa Banerjee, Prof. Dipshika Chakravorty, Prof. Gaiti Hasan, Dr. Bushra Ateeq, Dr. Shantala Hari Dass, and Dr. Devendra Singh to discuss our project proposal. We were able to evaluate our options and study alternative drug delivery carriers thanks to our interactions with them before deciding to finalize OMV’s as our drug carrier. After this encounter, Prof. Dipshika and our team had a thorough presentation with her, and she accepted to be our external mentor.

          <h3>Breast Cancer Awareness Survey</h3>
          <h5>Data Collection and Analysis</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            Once the team decided to use the drug delivery system to target breast cancer, we felt it was critical to ascertain how well-informed the general public is about the disease and whether there are any myths that we can dispel. So, with the help of Dr. Harilal Madhavan, we created a questionnaire and made sure we adhered to all the safety requirements for using human subjects in research. We made our survey available online in June 2022. We also collected print surveys from people that we believed we couldn't reach through online platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
              We received over 300 responses for our survey and we particularly aimed at finding correlations between different parameters we asked in the questionnaire.
              <br>
              The suvey is linked <a href="">here.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Analysis:</u>
            <br>
            <br>
            The survey has two sections, one was to check the level of awareness of public on detection and other aspects of breast cancer. The part B had certain statements, which the participant has to identify whether those statements are myths or facts. People from all age groups participated in the survey. We also made sure people who had different educational backgrounds and occupation also took part in the survey. The analysis of the data is provided <a class="button" id="six">here</a>.
            <div id="mod-container" class="mod-containercss">

                      <p style="text-align: left;">
                          One of our questions was to understand what people think about curing breast cancer, and most people did believe that it can be cured if detected early. We listed a list of factors and asked our participants to identify the breast cancer risk factors from those. Most of the people were not aware of all the risk factors. We further plotted those results to compare the responses with respect to occupation and education. It was observed that irrespective of the profession, respondents were not aware of the risk factors of breast cancer. But in terms of education, graduates and postgraduates were more aware of risk factors than those who had completed only till secondary or higher secondary education.

          <br>
          <p>
            iBreast is a preliminary screening test for Breast Cancer. A few members of our team spoke with an iBreast technician to learn how people are scanned at camps, whether people are reluctant to be screened, what challenges they encounter during the procedure, and what limitations the technique has.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            iBreast is a preliminary screening test. For confirmation, mammogram or FNAC is required. The main aim of organising screenings is to reach middle-class household women who don't prioritise their health over their family and chores. The system involves a portable sensor and a Bluetooth connected screen to view the image of 1/16th of the area at a stretch. Gradually we scan the entire area in parts and complete the scan. If there are any lesions or lumps it will show a red colour as an indication. There are few situations where false positive cases are shown.  However, this method has proven quite helpful for screening a number of patients and assisting them in receiving an early diagnosis of their ailment. Overall, she claimed that despite people's initial reluctance, after learning about cancer and the need for screening, they are prepared to undergo screening and to be kept informed of developments by the doctors.This was an inspiration for us to conduct a camp and spread awareness.

            Adv. Baburaj is the Vithura Grama Panchayat President. Panchayat is a local village council. Panchayat president is an elected representative who chairs the panchayat meetings. We spoke with him to know about the current breast cancer statistics of Vithura Panchayat. But he was unable to help us in that matter. We also wanted to know of current programs by local and central government to increase detection tests for cancer. He connected us to Asha workers. ASHA workers are Accredited Social Health Activists. But we were unable to reach our to them.

              <strong>Public Interviews</strong>
              <br><br>
              As soon as we began defining our stakeholders, it became clear that the general public is the most significant and significant stakeholder in our project. We therefore believed it was imperative to reach out to them and learn more about their perceptions of cancer and drug delivery mechanisms. While every team member travelled to their home states—Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and New Delhi—we went out and spoke with people from various walks of life to get a general sense of how issues related to breast cancer are viewed.
            </p>
            <p>
              These exchanges gave us a lot of new information, including the facts that :
              <ul>
                <li> Very few people were aware that men may develop breast cancer.</li>
                <li>Self-breast exams were not widely known.</li>
                <li>They were also unaware of the value of early diagnosis in treating the illness.</li>
              </ul>
              This served as our motivation for printing out informational pamphlets with essential breast cancer awareness information.

          <p>
            Our team organised a successful Breast Cancer Screening campaign for our institution's female housekeeping staff. IMA (Indian Medical Association) and KIMS Health Centre, Thiruvananthapuram collaborated on the event. Dr. Hemalatha assisted in the organisation of this programme. Dr. Kavitha Ravi was the honoured guest during the event. She is an adjunct professor at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. <a class="button" id="six">Read More</a>

                  The examination was administered utilising the iBreast Exam. It was handled by four KIMS Health Center technicians. The iBreastExam is a portable gadget that detects breast abnormalities. It is not a confirming test, although it can detect anomalies. The one-day screening camp was attended by around 35 housekeeping staff members. Participants were between the ages of 35 and 50. P roper written consent was obtained from the participants, and the respective doctors signed an MOU. To assure complete safety, we emailed the iGEM headquarters about our programme and obtained their approval before conducting tests. It is our responsibility to ensure that no stakeholders or members of the public are affected in any way by our project. Therefore, all safety regulations were fulfilled prior to implementing any programmes, especially large-scale ones.
                  <br><br>
                  The participants discussed their testing experiences. Nearly all of them were receiving screening tests for the first time, demonstrating the inaccessibility of such testing for persons living in rural areas. 8 percent of individuals who were tested came back positive, which is an extremely high percentage. Since the iBreast Exam is not a confirmatory test, they were referred for a proper confirmatory test and further for treatment.

          <h3>Awareness Talk</h3>
          <h5>Conducted during the Breast Cancer Screening Camp</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            We determined, through activities such as surveys and interviews with the public, that the public is unaware of breast cancer and how early detection and good knowledge can save thousands of lives. Lack of awareness prevented individuals from getting screened for breast cancer, resulting in late-stage diagnosis. Compared to early detection, the percentage of cancer patients who are cured is substantially lower when the disease is identified at a later stage. Consequently, we saw the need for awareness. We organised a campus-wide breast cancer awareness lecture for our institution's housekeeping staff. Dr. Hemalatha Goldwin, medical officer of IISER Thiruvananthapuram, delivered the lecture. So that the audience could comprehend, it was conducted in the native tongue (Malayalam). The discussion included breast cancer examination procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approximately 80 staff members attended this presentation. It was regarded to be highly useful by the audience. They were delighted to be attending their first breast cancer awareness talk.

              <strong>Pamphlets</strong>
              <br><br>
              The high percentage of positive iBreast Exam results indicated the prevalence of breast cancer. Our institute is nestled in the foothills of the western ghats, 40 kilometres from the main city of Thiruvananthapuram. People in the vicinity of our institute reside in rural areas and lack access to screening tools. Therefore, we decided to educate them on self-breast inspection techniques that can be undertaken in their homes. We distributed pamphlets on campus, in the neighbourhood near campus, and in our hometown. Brochures were available in English and three additional languages (Malayalam, Tamil, and Hindi). Illustrations were utilised to emphasise the SBE (Self Breast Examination) approach. It was created so that people may easily comprehend and follow the instructions. Dr. Hemalatha Goldwin verified it before to distribution.

          <h2>Drama for Breast Cancer Awareness</h2>
          <h5>In collaboration with the Drama Club of IISER TVM</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            We desired to increase the reach of our awareness campaigns. In addition to expanding the programme, our goal was to reach people of all ages and genders with our message. We decided to stage a play in public. We in collaboration with the Theatrics society of IISER Thiruvananthapuram performed a play to the public in one of the busiest mall of Thiruvananthapuram city - Mall of Travancore.  Team members and drama club members collaborated to create a play about the significance of early breast cancer screening. In the drama, a housewife discovers that the lump on her breast may be breast cancer after watching television awareness programmes. Her examination results indicate that she has breast cancer. A few months of treatment were enough to eradicate cancer. It disseminates the idea that cancer screening tests are available and can save lives when used appropriately. We also described how to diagnose breast cancer through our play. The audience considered our performance to be beneficial and appreciates our efforts. In addition, we presented them with leaflets that explained breast cancer detection in depth.

She is a passionate researcher who is also interested in scientific communication. We had questions regarding how to advance the research and communication components of our project. She provided strategies for communicating synbio to non-STEM audiences. She encouraged that students take classes in synthetic biology, as they are the next generation and synthetic biology is a booming subject. We had a list of events planned for the outreach portion of our mission. She instructed to prioritise the most crucial items and implement them after appropriate planning. After speaking with her, we devised a methodical plan for the outreach initiatives. We decided to offer synbio lessons to schoolchildren. Her advise to focus on school students proved useful, as the questions posed by students throughout our interactions with them expanded our creativity even more.

Not just about the knockers but also their difficulties and trauma they were facing. It became a platform for people going through the disease to freely share how they were feeling.
                    <br><br>
                    First step towards forming this Non Profit Organization was contacting her doctor and finding out the demand of knockers (50,000 mastectomies in a year - USA). Once the doctor gave them a number, the next step was to find resources in terms of the yarn and people to knit, so they could provide these knitted knockers for free. In 10 years, they've grown to having 1900 medical clinics registered with them and 60 international countries. Every month 10-12,000 knockers are being handed out. Her strategy for this was to raise awareness and get the local community there to involve and provide for their region. Knitters make the knockers and send it to their headquarters where they stuff them and post them to clinics.
