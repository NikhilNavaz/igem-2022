        Overview

        Synthetic biology uses engineering principles to re-envision the potential of biological systems, with applications ranging from therapeutics to agriculture. It is a relatively new field, with enormous potential, and as young researchers working in the field, we consider it our responsibility to communicate the beauty of synthetic biology to the public. Interacting with our stakeholders helped us realise how science can inspire people and the central role that science communication plays in bridging the gap between academia and the general public. To do this, we first established a set of goals that we would like to achieve through our initiative, these include:
        Increasing the public appreciation for science
        Showcasing the recent research findings
        Expanding the general understanding of scientific research
        Encouraging the development of a more scientific temperament among the general public
        Effective unbiased communication of the different perspectives on the same matter

        Our team made use of the various modes of communication to achieve these goals and effectively propagate and create awareness about science and synthetic biology among the masses.

        Highlights
        Promoted the creation of  art, music and literature showcasing science by organising biology-themed contests such as Kalakrithi -A nationwide art competition, Bioku -  A poetry writing competition and producing our very own music parody SynVibe
        Developed Synbio CSI (Crime Scene Investigation), a mystery-filled simulation designed to help university students learn about biosafety and the rules and regulations that govern bioethics.
        Created a short documentary film titled  “Track your Biowaste” to shed light on the disposal of laboratory wastes after conducting extensive research into our institute's biowaste management system.
        Introduced our project to the student community of our institute through our interactive event, “Meet Team iGEM’22”.
        Conducted a Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening drive for the housekeeping staff of our institute and conducted a Public Interview Series to assess the level of awareness regarding breast cancer among the general public.
        Spread awareness about breast cancer through “Let’s Fight with Courage”, a drama showcase. Conducted a collaborative iGEM event We-Talk, a women’s talk series addressing women's health.
        Constantly educated the audience about science and synthetic biology through our social media handles with the help of informative posts and videos.

        Who are our stakeholders?
        The intended audience consists of various stakeholders. We made a conscious effort in order to cater to a diverse audience pool of children as well as adults of different age groups, people with varied educational backgrounds and different native languages. We also uploaded our presentations and videos on social media channels in order to be globally accessible.

        When was it conducted?
        We made sure that the academic schedules of the students were taken into consideration when planning all our events. We wanted to celebrate science on special days by planning our events centred around the theme. (For eg. Celebrating National Science Day)

        What are we communicating?
        Careful consideration was given to the needs of our target audience in the creation of all of our educational materials. We made sure to design our content keeping in mind the prerequisite knowledge required for it . In order to make our materials more accessible to readers outside of STEM , we have simplified the language used and provided clear definitions for all the scientific terms. To reach the widest possible audience, we also incorporated a number of mediums of communication.

        Why is this knowledge important to be imparted?
        It's important for us researchers to explain genetic engineering and synthetic biology to the public in order to reduce the stigma associated with using GMOs and inspire the next generation to use synthetic biology to solve real-world problems. The production of vaccines is a well-known benefit of modifying organisms. Our educational materials have highlighted such lifesaving applications and current advances of the field. During our interactions with our target audience, we learned the needs of different educational tools and improvised our sessions and created handbooks based on their feedback.

        Where have we conducted?

        All of the events were either held online or in person, depending upon the convenience of the hosts and attendees. Online events provided us with a platform to reach out to a global audience and facilitated us to host some of the pioneers in the field.  We also organised in-person sessions for students in our community and shared educational materials with nearby schools.

        SynVibe - iGEMers Musicals
        Often we do not get to showcase the entire iGEM journey to the public. Hence to bring forth our life as iGEMers, our team, in collaboration with iGEM IISER Tirupati, present SynVibe, a music parody that highlights the challenges of being an iGEM team and how we overcome these. The teams started with songwriting, followed by directing and choreographing for the music video. Two extremely well-known songs, Dance monkey and I don't care served as the basic tracks for our synbio parody.

        This song had a good reception from the audience, who enjoyed seeing a glimpse into our life and lab work.
        Bioku - Online Haiku Competition
        A traditional Japanese haiku is a three-line poem that has a total of seventeen syllables and is written with a syllable count that alternates between 5/7/5.  The haiku poetic form is known for its focus on nature imagery and emphasis on minimalism, intensity, and clarity. We encouraged students to use figurative language to capture the spirit of the biology lab, where fascinating investigations into nature's mysteries are conducted. Thus, we held a competition called BIOKU - online haiku competition. The bioku competition's theme was "In the Biology lab," and its target audience was college students. To get everyone in the mood for writing haikus, we started our contest with our event poster having a haiku in it!. Here are the winning submissions:

        History of Lab Instruments
        Most of us have never thought about the number of iterations everyday lab instruments such as pipette or centrifuge have gone through to result in their current functional forms. To help us realise their role in the progress of science and appreciate the exceptional advancements in the equipment we use today, we present a series of videos, "The History of Lab Instruments", highlighting some of the myriad designs, through the decades, for each seemingly straightforward instrument and the brilliant minds behind them. Through these videos, we provided an overview of the development of three pieces of laboratory gear: the microscope, the pipette, and the ultracentrifuge. To connect with our online audience, the format of reels was chosen and through beautiful illustrations and fascinating facts, we were able to gain over 5K views for the series.

        Synbio CSI - Crime Scene Investigation

        There is a lack of understanding of safety organisations, their missions, and potential threats. Without being aware of the potential hazards involved with research, as well as the organisations' policies in place to handle such situations, it is impossible to be responsible researchers. To do so, we envisaged an event where we could present synthetic biology, the potential misuse of synbio and existing biosafety organisations and protocols in place through a murder mystery, Synbio CSI (Crime Scene Investigation). This discord-based online event is centred around solving a murder case with synthetic biology and biosafety as the backdrop. The hidden riddles and storyline were inspired by synbio and biosafety approaches, respectively.

        As a genre, murder mysteries are unparalleled in their ability to keep the reader's attention. One of the reasons for its success is that, rather than offering an entertainment experience, this genre requires you to employ your own cleverness when you consume media actively. Adapting murder mystery techniques to instructional design may make learning more interesting. So, we asked students to put on detective hats, get magnifying glasses, and actively participate.

        #Caption: Synbio CSI Poster  Single C10.png

        By referencing probable misuses of synthetic biology, various real-life instances, some of which we have described here, and developing fictional scenarios around them, the world-building was kept as realistic as possible. We also referred to and centred the tale around organisations committed to safety and their efforts toward biosafety and accountability, such as the Biological Weapons Convention, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Cartagena Protocol.

        Without giving too much away, the story takes place during the fictional 10th Biological Weapons Convention review meeting.  Against this backdrop, the participants will have to follow up on an anonymous tip about an artefact that threatens the convention and everyone present. takes them on a wild goose chase across labs and locales, with multiple murders interspersed with various facets of safety and safety hazards. The story and puzzle were divided into four acts that the teams had to complete. The participants' ultimate purpose was to figure out what had happened, why the conference was in peril, and who could have been the main culprit.

         PLOT DETAILS C15.pdf (attached as pdf, i’ll attach)

        Results
        The teams jumped to try and guess the story from the first act, but they were slowed down by the puzzles that drew away their time and attention for which they had to develop an understanding about DNA digital storage and genetic circuits.  The entire plot also highlighted how the characters of the story care about safety and how it impacts the consequences within the story. The teams were quite fervent with solving the mystery and even took more than the stipulated time to get to the bottom of the story. Some of the team results are attached here.

        Feedbacks:
        The teams were surprised with the amount of material that was available to them, as they expected it be a much simpler murder mystery. By taking a look at their answer reports and looking at their discussions, we were quite enthused that some of the teams were able to figure out the synbio logic behind the puzzles and the story points, filled with safety. It was rewarding to see them pick up some new information while having a good time at the event.

        Track your Biowaste
        As researchers, it is essential for us to be knowledgeable about the proper and secure disposal of the bio-waste that is produced in our laboratories. The fact that our campus is located in the foothills of the Western Ghats must direct our attention to how we handle the disposal of the laboratory waste. We conducted in-depth research and a number of interviews with individuals involved in the biowaste management system.

        Please find attached a pdf document detailing all of our findings throughout the course of our journey following the waste produced by our institute.
        TRACK YOUR BIOWASTE C16.pdf To be attached

        A survey was taken to understand the awareness of biowaste management among our institute students. We got to know from the survey results that more than 60% of the students have not heard of the biomedical waste management facility IMAGE (Indian Medical Association Goes Eco-Friendly) that is responsible for safe bio-waste disposal. Moreover, they vaguely had an idea about what happens after the disposal of waste. Hence, in response to this survey, we decided to make a short documentary film, “Track you Biowaste”, where we tracked a pipette from our biology laboratory to its final destination where it was segregated and disposed of.

        We screened our documentary film for all students on the occasion of the Swachhata Pakhwada  observed by the Government of India's Ministry of Education in all educational institutions from September 1st to the 15th, 2022. Swachhata Pakhwada(Cleanliness for 15 days) is an initiative of 15 days of different activities for the Clean India Mission. This year’s theme of Swachhata Pakhwada was cleanliness on the campus, and hence our screening was perfect for the occasion. There was a mix of student audience, from undergraduate to graduate students.

        WORLD CANCER DAY

        We launched our project on World Cancer Day by hosting a fun Google Forms quiz competition called UNRAVEL. The riddles were based on cancer terms, and the goal was to familiarise people with them. We also asked them to take note of the code number that appeared alongside each question, and the final question included the password 4222, which stood for February 4, 22 - World Cancer Day. After the participant successfully completed all of the riddles, the final page contained information about World Cancer Day and a brief preview of our project. We received over 80 responses. The quiz was a huge hit, and we publicised all the winners on our social media channels. The comments below are examples of the ones received.

        INTERNATIONAL DAY OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN SCIENCE

        We created a reel highlighting the women in biology and their specialised fields to commemorate International Day of Women and Girls in Science. We shared this reel and published a short quiz as an Instagram story series in which we revealed a picture of one of the scientist’s in the reel and asked them to Guess the Scientist. We then shared the scientists' information on our Instagram accounts the following day. That reel received 7000 views on Instagram. Check out our reel here

        NATIONAL DNA DAY

        We had an amazing team building event to celebrate World DNA Day, with all of our members creating their own DNA helix origami. We all made long strands of DNA and enjoyed doing some art and craft outside the lab with our hands instead of gloves and tips. We also created a short tutorial on how to make your own DNA origami so that everyone could try it out. On World DNA Day, we shared the video on our social media accounts. Our Instagram video received over 2,000 views. Check out our reel here

        WORLD ART DAY
        On World Art day, we held Kalakrithi, an all-India art competition for students in grades 1 through 12 to appreciate science via art. We received over fifty responses from across India.  Read the Kalakrithi section for more details.

        WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL DAY
         On the occasion of World Environmental day, we collaborated with iGEM Villianius who came up with an instagram post appreciating the water bodies in our surroundings. Read the Collaboration page for more details.

        THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF WORLD’S INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
        On the occasion of international day of the world’s Indigenous People, we collaborated with the  Queens iGEM team and made an instagram story honouring Dr. G N Ramachandran, an eminent scientist from India who developed the Ramachandran plot to analyse the spectrum of protein conformations, which remains one of the most significant contributions to the field of structural biology. Read the Collaboration page for more details.
        WORLD MICROBIOME DAY
        An Instagram story series featuring the kids' imaginative microbes with superpowers from our SCIBIO virtual camp was created in honour of World Microbiome Day. We were amazed to find that most of their superpower microbes are the very ones that synthetic biologists like ourselves are working to create by manipulating the microbial machinery. A bacteria that feeds on fundi is one such organism. At a deeper level of analysis, the goal of this superpower is to develop a bacteria that is effective against fungicidal infestations. This was in fact the goal of the previous iGEM team from IISER TVM. To combat fungal infection, they sought to cultivate bacteria capable of producing antifungal chitinase.

        Project Communication
        explanation

        In India, breast cancer is rapidly becoming one of the leading causes of both morbidity and mortality. The lack of awareness regarding breast cancer, the inaccessibility of health care facilities, and the stigma that is attached to the cancer have all led to underdiagnosis and undertreatment. Detection of cancer at an early stage is incredibly important for a higher chance of complete remission. Since people of all ages and gender have the risk of being susceptible to breast cancer, we identified our stakeholders and created breast cancer awareness through a wide variety of communication strategies.

        Project Reveal

        We revealed our project idea to work on breast cancer on World Cancer Day by hosting a fun Google Forms quiz competition called UNRAVEL. With over 80 participants, our quiz with riddles serves to introduce the several terms associated with cancer to the common public. Extending this, we wanted to present the ideation and design of our project to the student community of our campus. We organised “Meet Team iGEM’22” an offline meet-up for us to finally unravel our project for the year in an extremely interactive session.

        We invited the entire student community and faculty members to the event via social media posts and personal invitations, providing a batch-by-batch brief introduction to iGEM and the event. Our members visited the maths, physics, chemistry and biology classes to spread the word about iGEM and invite the students to the session. We also made posters and put them up throughout our campus. We also created a fun promo event, where we requested the students to spot our posters and take selfies and story it.

        #Caption: Promotion of our Project Reveal

        With more than 100 people attending the event, all the members of the team individually introduced different aspects of our iGEM project. Through the use of the Mentee-mentor website, we were also able to engage in two-way communication with our target audience to determine which social media platform is most suitable for effective science education and communication, and it turned out to be Instagram, followed by Youtube.

        We also gave our audience an exclusive chance to name our mascot Omivon. Omivon before getting its name was a gender neutral mascot of our project duonco. Its dual colours represents the two different types of vesicles that we are developing to have increased specificity towards cancer cells. The students came up with great suggestions incorporating our project idea and cancer. Taking inspiration from this we decided on “Omivon” originating from the star of our project, Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs).

        #Caption: Snippets from the Project Reveal

        Further, we also got a chance to showcase our project idea on a display board, located in our biology department. This enabled us to reach out to the people who were unable to attend the project reveal. Anyone who enters the building will have a chance to look at our project idea through the display board.

        Find our Project Reveal presentation here, which gives a basic overview of iGEM and its various aspects, along with a short introduction to our project idea.

        We also made use of a self-explanatory animation video to convey our project idea

        Breast Cancer Awareness session
        Our team members who volunteered for a breast cancer screening camp conducted in Chathancode, Kerala in 2021 realised that in our small community of Vithura (with a population of 20,000), the number of breast cancer cases was alarming, and there's an urgent need of awareness and screening drive to identify the cases and provide early treatment. We then went forward to conduct an awareness and screening drive on our campus itself. We decided to cater our session for the housekeeping staff of our institute, as we realised from our survey that they lacked the awareness and the resources for regular screening sessions. The majority of our institute housekeeping staff are women over the age of 30 years and hence fall under the risk category of breast cancer.  With the help of the medical officer of our institute Dr Hema Francis, we conducted a Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening Camp for all the housekeeping staff of our campus.

        To gather all of 150 housekeeping staff at the same time, we approached our institute management who were very supportive of our initiative as this was the first time ever an activity dedicated to the housekeeping staff was conducted. We encouraged the staff to participate in the camp by distributing event pamphlets in malayalam and sending mass messages to all of them inviting them to attend the camp.

        #Caption: The Invitation pamphlet in both native language Malayalam and English(the blue dress in the illustration represent the uniform dress colour of our housekeeping staff)

        The Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening Camp was inaugurated by our chief guest Dr. Kavitha Ravi, National Secretary, Indian Medical Association (IMA) Women Doctors Wing. Following the inauguration, Dr, Hema Francis conducted breast cancer awareness sessions with the use of slides with information in malayalam for all the staff present there. We also distributed awareness pamphlets that were translated to malayalam.

        Parallely in collaboration with IMA and KIMS hospital, Trivandrum, we organised a breast cancer screening drive for the interested people. We got a chance to communicate with people from different age groups from the local area. From our interaction we got to know that few of them have a family history of breast cancer and they were potentially at higher risk than others. Hence we arranged for them to be given priority in the Screening drive. More information regarding the screening can be found in HP Section.
        Public Interview
        After communicating with people within our institute community, we took our communication one step further by interviewing a diverse set of people from different parts of India through a public interview series. We got to communicate and assess the level of awareness of different people from various age groups, genders, professional backgrounds etc. We primarily asked them three questions:
        Which age group do you think is mostly affected by breast cancer?
        Are you aware of the procedure for self breast examination?
        Can men get Breast Cancer?

        The responses to these questions brought to our notice that people may not be aware of self breast examinations, whether they fall into the age classified risk group for breast cancer,  men being affected with breast cancer. We therefore, distributed our awareness pamphlets and discussed with them some of the common myths about breast cancer. They were very appreciative of our attempt in creating the pamphlet for their awareness.

        Stage Play for Breast Cancer Awareness
        Our goal is to initiate a breast cancer awareness campaign to spread awareness without any age, gender, or language constraints. But in order to overcome the ignorance of people as shown by the survey (HP link) and interview series, adopting an innovative approach is imperative. Theatre - being one of the greatest platforms for creating social awareness became the perfect media for us to spread our message.

        Hence our team collaborated with Theartrics Society of our institute to present “Let's fight with Courage” - A breast cancer awareness drama focusing on self breast examination. The drama was orchested in the vernacular language of malayalam. The posters used as props were also translated to malayalam for better reach.

        The Mall of Travancore, one of the biggest malls in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of the state, was supportive of our campaign and provided us with a stage for orchestrating our drama. Through thisevent we were able to captivate a wide range of audience to join our campaign. After the drama, we distributed our awareness pamphlets and had great discussions regarding the same with some of the people present there.

        Women Talk Series
        October is celebrated as the breast cancer awareness month, hence is very special to our hearts. The whole world indulges in organising various events to spread awareness and raise funds for breast cancer treatment and research.

        A talk series aimed to create awareness was, according to us, an event best suited for the month of October. We initiated a collaboration to bring together all the iGEM teams working on Women health-related projects on this special occasion. We present ‘We-Talk’, a collaborative event organised by four iGEM teams from across India: IISER Thiruvananthapuram, IISER Tirupati, IISER Berhampur and IIT Roorkee targeting a wide range of audience from students to the general public.
