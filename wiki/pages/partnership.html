        <br>
        <p>During the duration of our project we interacted with various other teams around the globe. We exchanged ideas….

        <p>
          The long wait for months to find a team working on vesicles based drug delivery systems ended when Pau Marin, team lead of iGEM University of Barcelona texted us on slack. But when we came to know about their project, we were more than excited for a long term collaboration! Our project was centred around using bacterial outer membrane vesicles targeting breast cancer and UB’s on using extracellular vesicles (EVs) to target Burkitt's Lymphoma. With a similar project idea we were thrilled to look into the overlapping segments in our project.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 26th June, 2022 we had our first meeting with them. This was the start of a long and fruitful relationship. In this meeting both the teams presented their respective projects and posed some interesting questions. We also realised the many parallels between the two projects and were sure that it’d lead to a fruitful iGEM journey together.

        <p>
          During our project exchange session, we had a brief discussion regarding our cloning plans. From UB wetlab team, we learned about Golden gate cloning and its potential.

        <h2>The Mentorship Journey Begins!</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Understanding iGEM cyle</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          For UB it was their first time participating in iGEM. We were able to help and guide UB in the nascent stages of their project. Since we were working on similar projects, we were able to inspire each other during the project design and execution phase. We had multiple interactive sessions where we gave them an idea on how the iGEM cycle works. We went through the medal criteria and clarified their queries on different aspects of achieving the best out of iGEM.

            </p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
          We were able to resolve their queries on the border line between human practices and integrated human practices. As a followup to this meeting, Merina from our HP team had a fruitful discussion with Julia from their HP team. They mentioned that our mentoring has indeed helped in framing a better picture of iGEM deliverables and medal criteria. In addition, we had a discussion before preliminary judging form submission, to clarify queries and technical difficulties that we faced during submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the initial meeting, we met again to go over the common elements we can focus on for the partnership duration. Proposed Implementation, Math modelling, Human Practices were the potential options. Our core ideas were the same- using vesicles as delivery vehicles- the difference lies in us using bacteria to produce OMVs and them using mammalian cells to do the same.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Math Modelling</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Major work of UB in modelling aspect was in docking studies. In addressing one of our modelling questions, we are also making use of docking. Nikhil, the modelling head from our team got in touch with Alejandro, the modelling representative from their side and got started with active discussions on docking studies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Human Practices</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Spreading awareness about our projects and cancer in general was the common ground we figured out in human practices. We exchanged informative sources on our projects.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Proposed Implementation</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          We had our first proposed implementation brainstorming meeting on 14th July, 2022. Here we decided that we will partner on proposed implementation throughout the course of the project. Our team gave a detailed overview of what is expected in the proposed implementation and how we went about structuring our proposed implementation last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          We discussed the crosstalk in drug action mechanism, how mRNA enzymes in OMVs are similar to siRNA mechanisms in the case of EVs. As the idea revolves around using vesicles as drug delivery systems we thought it would be a good idea to look into the clinical trials and loading of cargo into OMVs/EVs. We organised the PI content into sections based on similarities and differences between our projects and assigned team members to work on it in a collaborative manner. We decided to meet once in two weeks,go through and improve upon each other's ideas. To continuously assess our progress in this regard, we created a common WhatsApp group.

          We had a follow up monthly update meeting on 16th August, 2022 where we discussed individual aspects of each team's implementation such as clinical trials, mass production of vesicles, safety and restructured our draft. We also decided to work on a market analysis of the respective countries to come up with a realistic entrepreneurial plan for the projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was followed by the next monthly meeting on 14th September, 2022 where we went over the edits that were suggested and did some compilation of the information.
        </p>

        <h2>From mentoring to mutual guidance</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The journey from mentoring UB to them giving us inputs and suggestion was beautiful. We felt great to see them grow throughout the iGEM process.
        </p>
        <p>
          UB’s Market Analysis study became an inspiration for us to look into the market analysis of the APAC region. As they were actively working on contribution and creating parts, they could help us in figuring out uploading our sequences and editing our part pages in iGEM parts registry.

          We are truly glad to have partnered with iGEM UBarcelona, we were able to provide some guidance as they were a first time iGEM team and also received some very insightful information which made the implementation of the project what it is today. Apart from the project related discussion we had fun sessions especially near to wiki freeze where both teams were stressed upto the peak. The chit-chat sessions with them made the iGEM journey blissful. Looking forward to meeting them in person in Paris!

        <h4>A partnership journey alongside Outreach and HP</h4>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          Getting started with a meet up and exchanging the project, we had no clue that iGEM IISER Berhampur would be our iGEM friends for the entire duration. IISER Berhampur was working on APT4UTI, a platform developed at the point-of-care for the detection of uropathogenic bacteria. Their project caught our attention as they are also addressing a health issue affecting majorly women population.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first meetup comprised of teams presenting the project idea and the progress made so far. In the second meeting, we figured out that human practices and outreach are segments where we can go ahead hand in hand. We understood that it is high time we spread awareness on women health issue. Lots of suggestions came up including a global talk series in collaboration with the iGEM teams addressing women’s issues and a comic strip series featuring the mascots of teams and portraying synbio through comic elements
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>We-Talk</h3>
        <p>
          We decided to go ahead with the We- Talk, a women talk series. We scoured through iGEM projects and found teams that addressed women's health issues.  Both IISER TVM and IISER Berhampur decided to go ahead with iGEM IISER Tirupati,IIT Roorkee, Yale and Tu Delft. Later Yale and Tu Delft couldn't make it to the event due to their hectic schedule. Our meetup sessions turned out to be a blend of four Indian iGEM teams sharing ideas. From talk series it turned into a 3 day forum with talks on cervical and breast cancer, menstrual hygiene and challenges in adolescent girls, an interview with founder of OncoStem Diagnostics, panel discussion and a fun quiz session.

        <br>
        <p>
          On the first day, we had a quiz session when Science meets fun, hosted by Tirupati. On the next day a talk was organised by <strong>Dr. Indira Palo, Gynecologist & Obstetrician Doctor</strong> on the topic Menstrual Hygiene and Challenges in Adolescent Girls, which was hosted by IISER Berhampur. As a continuation to that we had a session with <strong>Dr Prerna Lakhwani, Senior Gynecologic Oncologist</strong> on the topic Cervical Cancer & Breast Cancer hosted by IIT Roorkee. We wrapped up the session with a panel discussion <i>A round-robin among collaborators</i>and an interview with <strong>Dr. Manjiri Bakre, CEO and Founder of OncoStem Diagnostics</strong> hosted by IISER TVM.

        <h3>Information Pamphlet</h3>
        <p>
          We were brainstorming on how to spread awareness about breast cancer and UTI. Our human practices teams did meet up and came up with the idea of an information pamphlet. To reach out to the local community we translated the pamphlets in regional languages as well. To help each other, we got their pamphlet printed and spread across.

        <h3>WHY? - Sci Card Game</h3>
        <p>
          We were successful in creating awareness among the general public, but the question of how to communicate science to kids remained to be addressed. We came up with the idea of WHY? Science based card game. Science finds its foundation in the curiosity to ask questions. With the IISER Berhampur team we came up with questions that would arose curiosity in kids and urge them to think beyond the box. We ensured that the images are from what the kids see around them everyday
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is such that the student has to take out a random card from a pack and see the image, think why it is so and try to answer the question. If they aren't able to arrive at an answer the team member would help them.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Syn-Bio Worksheet</h3>
        <p>
          Now, the challenge was to narrow down to synthetic biology from the broad science subject. During one of our meetups, one of the IISER Berhampur team members put forth a suggestion of coming up with a synbio based worksheet. We brainstormed ideas to make the most fun filled synbio based worksheet. We came up with crossword puzzles, scramble, word finding and true false questions. Berhampur contributed to the brain storming session and came up with questions.
        </p>
