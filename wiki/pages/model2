  <h1 class="wrapall_hd">Mathematical modeling</h1>
  <p class="wrapall_para">
    Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in understanding the project keeping precision l'esprit. For DUONCO, we segregated the entire project into its constituent steps to look at the avenues we had in hand.
  </p>
    <img class="wrapall_img" src="images/Project plan.png" alt="">

    <p class="wrapall_para">We identified 7 areas where we could work on. Upon further counselling from experts, we realistically narrowed down our search to four. These avenues have been described below. We have also provided with a picture of our understanding as well as all the equations used and have cited the works we have used for achieving our goals</p>

  <h1 class="wrapall_hd">OMV INTERNALISATION</h1>
<p class="wrapall_para">
    This is one of the most important areas of the project we hoped to model.
    The output from this step gives us clues if our experiments are theoretically sound.
    OMV internalisation


    is the process where the OMV goes into the cell and releases its contents.

    This is the most important step of the whole process as this determines the endocytosis will
    be successful or not. An OMV that binds to the receptor is internalised by allowing it to form
    a pouch in the cell membrane and the OMV enters the cell through this pouch and releases
    the prodrug inside the cell. Acro pinocytosis, clathrin mediated endocytosis, caveolin mediated
    endocytosis, or non‐caveolin, non clathrin mediated endocytosis. These pathways have all been
    implicated in mediating OMV entry into host cells. Clathrin coated pits are formed allowing
    OMVs to utilise toxin receptor mechanism to internalise the cargo. Different levels of purity in
    preparation of OMVs affects the efficiency of drug delivery. OMV internalisation was also
    mathematically modelled using one dimensional differential equation allowing us to attain
    greater accuracy in overall understanding of the mechanism.

    Initial vescicular association with the membrane can be descibed as given below
    \[C+C_{bs} \underset{k_{d}}{\stackrel{k_{a}}{\rightleftharpoons}} C_{b}\]

    the number of vesicles with single ligand bound to surface receptor. \(k_{a1}\) and \(k_{d1}\) represent the association and dissociation rate constants

<h1 class="wrapall_hd"> TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION </h1>
<p class="wrapall_para">
  Transcription and Translation are the processes by which genetic information or instruction is passed
  on by cells during cell division. Transcription is the process in which a DNA strand is copied onto an
  RNA strand to encode proteins. The RNA polymerase binds to the promoter DNA and transcribes the
  messenger RNA which serves as the template strand for protein synthesis. The ribosome binds to this
  template strand during translation and codes for the respective protein. The quantification of transcription
  is important as it controls which proteins are to be expressed and at what rate. A proper model of
  Transcription and translation must take into account the various leakage factors and the initiation and
  termination rates during the various steps of the process. A transcription circuit coupled with
  translation circuit translated into a set of differential equations is what gives us the rate and relation
  between various elements factored in our model. This allows us to achieve a decently accurate picture
  of the genetic activity inside the cell.

    A main question we wanted to answer was about the rate of production of proteins inside the cell. By knowing
    our inputs precisely, how could we predict the rate of production of proteins inside the cell? To answer this question,
    we made a flow diagram of the genetic activity of our interest inside the cell. The diagram is as given below.

    <p class="wrapall_para">
    Here,to get the Protein output vs IPTG concentration on the extracellular space, we try to take into account each and every
    metabolic process that could be realistically modeled within the time frame available to us.

    Our gene of interest is inserted into E.coli SKBR3 using the plasmid pGEX-4T-1. The plasmid we used in our case had the
    tac promoter in place for the lac operator that a normal lac operon model has. As such the system can be modeled as given below:

    (1) Conversion of LacI gene to LacI mRNA through transcription
    \[\phi \overset{K_{tcI}}\to mRNA_{LacI}\]
    Loss of LacI mRNA through decay
    \[ mRNA_{LacI}\overset{K_{dmI}}\to\phi \]

    \[\frac{d[mRNA_{LacI}]}{dt} = K_{tcI} - K_{dmI}[mRNA_{lacI}]\]

    (2) Coversion of LacI mRNA to LacI protein
    \[mRNA_{LacI} \overset{K_{Ktl}}\to mRNA_{LacI} + LacI\]

   Loss of LacI
    \[LacI\overset{K_{dpI}}\to\phi\]
    \[\frac{d[LacI - IPTG_{in}]}{dt} = K_{fI}[lacI][IPTG_{in}] - K_{bI}[LacI - IPTG_{in}]\]
    (3)IPTG

<h1 class="wrapall_hd">ELECTROPORATION</h1>
<p class="wrapall_para">
    Electroporation is the method of using high voltage electric pulses to increase cell permeability
    facilitating delivery of drug and genetic material into the cell. In our project this technique has played
    a crucial role in loading the drug into the OMV’s which acts as the vehicle for drug delivery in this
    targeted model of delivery. The challenge was to optimize the size of the pore so as to enhance the
    rate of drug carried in each OMV without compromising the drug loading process. Hence a
    mathematical model was created to calculate the optimum pore size to be created and the most
    effective carrying capacity of each OMV. This was done with help of one-dimensional differential
    equations that took the pore size and carrying capacity as the variables. Protocols to be followed are to
    be carefully studied as serious damage to OMVs jeopardise the final aim of the drug delivery
    mechanism.

    <h2 class="wrapall_hd2">Pore Density</h2>
    <p class="wrapall_para">We assume the OMV's to be spherical in nature occupying a radius R. The electric field applied induces pores on the surface.
      Their exact size and radius distribution depends on the electric field being applied. One must be careful with this process, because any slight mistake
      could lead to irreversible electroporation and disruption of the membrane integrity.

      The pore density N is governed by the well known Krassova and Filev equation, given below
      \[\frac{d N}{d t}=\alpha\exp\left(\frac{V_{m}}{V_{e p}}\right)^{2}\left[1-\frac{N}{N_{0}\exp\left(q\left(\frac{V_{m}}{V_{e p}}\right)^{2}\right)}\right]\]
    </p>

    <p class="wrapall_para">Where {V_{m}} is the transmembrane potential of the spherical cell in a uniform electric field defined as:
      \[{V_{m}} = 1.5E \times r_{c}cos\psi\]
    </p>

    <p class="wrapall_para">We isolate particulars of these equation using the below constants
    \[K = \alpha{e}^{\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{V_{ep}^{2}}}\]
    \[C = \frac{{e}^{-q{\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{V_{ep}^{2}}}}}{N_{o}}\]
  </p>
  <p class="wrapall_para"> The equation then becomes:
    \[\frac{dN_{ep}}{dt} = K(1 - N_{ep}C)\]
    Solving the above ordinary differential equation yeilds us:
    \[-{\frac{ln(1 - N_{ep}C)}{C}}{\rvert}_{N_{epo}}^{{N_{ep}}^{t}}\]
    \[-KCt = ln{(\frac{1 - {N_{ep}}^{t}C}{1 - {N_{ep}}^{o}C})}\]
    \[e^{-kct} = \frac{1 - {N_{ep}}^{t}C}{1 - {N_{ep}}^{o}C}\]
    \[e^{-kct}{(1 - {N_{ep}}^{o}C)} = {1 - {N_{ep}}^{t}C}\]
    The constants for our case are given below:
    \[\alpha = 1\times10^{9}\]
    \[V_{m} = 0.08\]
    \[V_{ep} = 0.258\]
    \[{(\frac{V_{m}}{V_{p}})} = 0.3100775194\]
    \[{(\frac{V_{m}}{V_{p}})}^{2} = 0.096148\]
    \[e^{{(\frac{V_{m}}{V_{p}})}^{2}} = 1.10092\]
    \[e^{-{(\frac{V_{m}}{V_{p}})}^{2}} = 1.10092\]
    \[r_{m} = 0.8\times{10}^{-9}m\]
    \[r_{a} = 0.51\times{10}^{-9}m\]
    \[\frac{r_{m}}{r_{\alpha}} = 1.5686\]
    \[q = 2.46059\]
    \[K = \alpha{e}^{\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{V_{ep}^{2}}} = 1.10092\]
    \[C = \frac{{e}^{-q{\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{V_{ep}^{2}}}}}{N_{o}}= {(\frac{0.789322}{N_{o}})}\]
    We plug in these values for our original equation. It leads us to the plot shown below.
    \[{N_{ep}}^{t} = {\frac{1 - e^{-kct}{(1 - {N_{ep}}^{o}C)}}{C}}\]
    <!-- \[{N_{ep}}^{o} \to {N_{ep}}\; at\; t  = 0\]

<h1 class="wrapall_hd">LIGAND RECEPTOR INTERACTION</h1>
<p class="wrapall_para">
    Ligand receptor interactions are a major class of protein-protein interactions that regulate life
    processes and helps maintain specificity of various proteins and their functions. The conformational
    change that the ligand undergoes effectively acts as a lock and key mechanism which discriminates
    between proteins and makes sure that only the specific ligand binds to the receptor site.
    Understanding ligand receptor interactions and quantifying their rates are crucial for designing the pro
    drug delivery mechanism and ensuring the selective targeting of cancerous cells with minimum
    collateral damage to healthy cells. The rate at which ligand binds at the receptor mechanism and the
    probability of a ligand failing to do so give us important information in deciding the optimum dosage of
    the pro drug to be loaded. It also helps in finding the rate of reaction and the time taken for the
    successful completion of the binding. We proceed with finding the binding energies using Autodock Vina,
    a popular molecular docking software.


</p>
<h1 class="wrapall_hd">PRODRUG ENZYME INTERACTION</h1>
<p class="wrapall_para">
    Prodrug is the precursor drug that is inactive independently but activates itself as it combines with the
    promoiety. The damage to healthy cells is prevented by this inactive nature of prodrug, as the specific
    combination of proteins found on the cancerous cells will make sure that only pro drug and pro
    moiety enters the cell only in them and even if accidentally it enters in other cells only one of them
    enters and being inactive will cause no damage to the cell. The prodrug enzyme kinetics are quite
    important in understanding amount of prodrug required to destroy each cell and load it respectively.
    Chemical instability, poor water solubility, rapid pre systemic metabolism, inadequate absorption, and
    toxicity and many more hurdles in usual drug delivery mechanisms are overcome by the prodrug
    method. This method also has less toxicity and is efficient compared to other methods making it a
    suitable candidate for such processes.
