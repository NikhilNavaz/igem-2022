        <h1 id="head1" style="color: #002147">Overview</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          During the duration of our project, we interacted, collaborated and exchanged ideas with multitude of teams around the globe. Ranging from synbio music video to a 3 day forum comprising talks, panel discussion, interview and quiz! Collaborations has been a golden oppurtunity for us to interact with teams who come from diverse backgrounds and nationality, appreciate the beauty of how inclusive research can be, learn from each other and grow during the iGEM duration. Our amazing set of collaborators has played a crucial role in molding and improvising our thought process, project ideation and execution. We learned the importance of collaboration and interpersonal skills. The happy ending of each collaboration definitely bought smile to our faces. Apart from spreading awareness on project or synbio, we had created a lot of joyful moments to cherish.
        </p>
        <br>


        <h1 id="head3" style="color: #002147">Group Collaborations</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
          Brainstorming sessions with individual teams, in time collated to collaborating with multiple teams at once and organising events at much bigger scale. This enabled us to address a wider set of audience.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Collaborations We Hosted</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Among the group collaborations, for some of them we came up with the basic frame of event and then invited other teams to be a part of the venture. Though we hosted such collaborations, collaborators with their suggestions made the organisation and planning for event smoother and efficient.
        </p>

        <h3>We-Talk</h3>
        <p>
          Why not gather all of the teams addressing on women's issues under one roof? This thought prompted us to go for a grand collaboration! We had recurring meetups with teams iGEM IISER Tirupati, IISER Berhampur, IIT Roorkee, Yale and Tu Delft. We brainstormed on the best way to raise awareness about these women's issues and decided to have a three-day session comprising interviews, panel discussions, and talks with people and organisation that have made pioneering efforts to enhance women's lives. Due to the hectic schedule and time constraints, we decided to go ahead with IISER Tirupati, IIT Roorkee and IISER Berhampur.

          On the first day, we had a quiz session when Science meets fun, hosted by Tirapti. On the next day a talk was organised by <strong>Dr. Indira Palo, Gynecologist & Obstetrician Doctor</strong> on the topic Menstrual Hygiene and Challenges in Adolescent Girls, which was hosted by IISER Berhampur. As a continuation to that we had a session with <strong>Dr Prerna Lakhwani, Senior Gynecologic Oncologist</strong> on the topic Cervical Cancer & Breast Cancer hosted by IIT Roorkee. We wrapped up the session with a panel discussion <i>A round-robin among collaborators</i> and an interview with <strong>Dr. Manjiri Bakre, CEO and Founder of OncoStem Diagnostics</strong> hosted by IISER TVM.

        <h3>Come work with us!</h3>
        <p>
          What if you get a chance to roam around labs around the globe, beyond the continents and oceans. We felt that as research students it is our responsibility to introduce the laboratory facilities, not just limited to India but that of the global research community to an inaccessible community. We hope to give wings to the kids who dream to fly high, but are limited by the barriers of land and language. As a first step towards that big dream we collaborated with <strong>iGEM Patras, IISER Tirupati, Tec CEM, ABOA Finland and IISER Mohali</strong> to bring forth a mega lab tour video with snippets of lab facilities around the globe.

        <h3>All India iGEM meet</h3>
        <p>
          An iGEM India get together! AIIM hosted by iGEM IISc Bangalore, was indeed a platform for presenting our project and getting inputs from co-Indian teams, iGEM EPIC and experienced mentors. A three-day event comprising talks, presentations by Indian iGEM team, mentoring session by iGEM Global committee member Varsha, EPIC elevator pitch and an amazing poster session. Loaded with fun, we made friends from different parts of the country, people who are enthusiastic about the wonders synbio can create!</p>

        <h3>GMO Global Survey</h3>
        <p>
          IISER Mohali came up with a global survey to understand the opinion of the general public towards genetic engineering and the application of synthetic biology and how much the educational background and geographical location of the respondents affect their perspective towards GMO and Synthetic biology. With iGEM Mohali, Patras and AFCM Egypt we released the survey. To go through the survey, check <a href="">education page.</a>

        <p>
          A series of informative videos about the competition, synthetic biology, wet and dry labs! It is essential to ensure that iGEM, the international platform for active discussions on synthetic biology research, becomes accessible to everyone around the globe irrespective of their nationality and language. In this exciting mission we were able to be a part of, by creating the informative video in malayalam, the native language in Kerala. <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PqgxJDwR8DxeSBJ8RgKyTpO6KxhqdMK">Link for YouTube video</a>

        <p>
          One of the most exciting segments of our iGEM project was the collaborations that we did with individual teams. These one on one collaborations kickstarted with a team meetup and exchanging of project ideas, which turned out to be cool brainstorming and fun sessions.

        <h3>iGEM IISER Tirupathi</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Through some common friends, iGEM IISER Tirupati turned out to be our first collaborator and iGEM friends throughout the journey. Our journey with IISER Tirupati began back in the month of May. First meetup indeed turned out to be a platform where we exchanged project ideas and progress so far. It turned out to be a fun and interactive discussion where we brainstormed potential collaborations that can be undertaken. With a bunch of interesting ideas from the synbio version of the TV show Family Feud, cool and fun filled games like Jeopardy to a music parody video. After discussing within our teams we decided to go ahead with the music video. With an amazing set of lyricists, editors, videographers and directors music video started to brew up! Dance monkey and I don't care turned out to be synbio tracks, and the transition with a synbio rap!

        <h3>iGEM University of Barcelona</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          The epic collaboration that evolved into an incredible partnership! It all started when iGEM UB replied to a collaboration request in slack. To our astonishment, we got to know that both teams are addressing the same issue using different components. With excitement at its peak to finally meet a team with a similar idea, we had our first meetup with UB on  . They were working on addressing Burkitt Lymphoma using external vesicles (EVs) as drug delivery vesicles whereas we were working on targeting breast cancer using bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as drug delivery vehicles. We had a couple of brainstorming sessions where we looked into the possibilities of an HP collaboration, but later decided to go ahead with discussing the overlap aspects in the proposed implementation. Continuous meetings and discussions led to a partnership at a later stage.

        <h3>iGEM IISER Berhampur</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Started off with exchanging project ideas, we figured out that one common element in both our projects would be the fact that we are addressing women’s issues. We discussed about ways in which we could bring together iGEM teams addressing and tackling womens issues. We brainstormed ideas such as a comic strip series through which we’d be able to create awareness.

        <p>
          A brief but wonderful collaboration with iGEM Patras Med!  On world DNA day we teamed up to create a fun filled human DNA (hehe us being the bases). Later, we joined hands in creating a video series putting forth project ideas of iGEM teams around the globe. We were able to contribute the malayalam version of informative video.

        <p>
          Working on cervical cancer, we were excited to work on our common segments of project. Meeting team iGEM IIT Roorkee turned out to be an unforgettable experience where we exchanged our project ideas and realised the potencial of collaborating in math modelling aspects. This could have been a long term partnership, nevertheless we were able to collaborate with them on Women talk series.

        <p>
          A chitchat turned into a project exchange meetup! That’s our journey with iGEM ASIJ TOKYO team. Although their current project idea is to create an aptamer based detection kit for Hepatitis B, during the initial stages they were working on developing a detection kit for breast cancer. We were super thrilled when they approached us saying theyd love to discuss ways to create awareness about breast cancer. We appreciate that their outreach efforts arent limited to ongoing project.

        <br>
        <p>
          On the International day of the world's indigenous people, we took part in the cool collaboration by team iGEM Queens. We joined hands with them and celebrated Dr G N Ramachandran, one of the eminent scientists hailing from India who came up with Ramchandran plot to analyse the range of protein confirmations, which stays as one of the best contribution to the field of structural biology.
